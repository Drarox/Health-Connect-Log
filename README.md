## ü§î Why Health Connect Log?

Have you ever been in a situation where you couldn't track your workout because you didn't have your phone or watch with you? Maybe you were playing a team sport, swimming, or simply forgot your device.

**Health Connect Log** was created for those moments. It allows you to log with one click your past workouts to various health tracking apps like Google Fit, Samsung Health, and others that are compatible with Android's Health Connect. This way, you never miss a session and your health data stays complete.

*   **One-Tap Logging**: Log a workout from a preset with just a single tap.
*   **Customizable**: Set duration, calories burned, workout type, day of the week, and time for each preset.
